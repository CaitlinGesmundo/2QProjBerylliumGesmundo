		<p> Crohn's disease affects as many 780,000 Americans but is barely even talked	about in the Philippines. 23.8 per 100,000 people in the Philippines are diagnosed with some sort of IBD, and yet it takes months—even years—to diagnose. This affects the lives and careers of those affected by the disease negatively, as it interferes with work and school. Misdiagnosis is caused by lack of education and lack of knowledgeable doctors, and these factors can be detrimental to patients suffering from these disorders.</p>
		<p> This site serves as a basic rundown of the disease and others related to it.</p>
